Types of cash flow include: Cash from Operating Activities, Free Cash Flow to Equity, Free Cash Flow to the Firm, Net Change in Cash (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/cash-flow/).</p><p><strong>Causal research</strong> - allows causal inferences to be made; seeks to identify causea-nd-effect relationships (Zikmund, 2009, p.57).</p><p>The <strong>coefficient of variation (CV)</strong> - is a statistical measure of the dispersion of data points in a data series around the mean. The coefficient of variation represents the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, and it is a useful statistic for comparing the degree of variation from one data series to another, even if the means are drastically different from one another (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coefficientofvariation.asp).</p><p><strong>Correlation matrix</strong> - is the standard form for reporting observed correlation coefficients among multiple variables (Zikmund, 2009, p.562).</p><p>A <strong>confidence interval</strong> - is an estimate of an interval in statistics that may contain a population parameter. The unknown population parameter is found through a sample parameter calculated from the sampled data. For example, the population mean is found using the sample mean x. The interval is generally defined by its lower and upper bounds. The confidence interval is expressed as a percentage (the most frequently quoted percentages are 90%, 95%, and 99%). The percentage reflects the confidence level (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/confidence-interval/).</p><p>The <strong>Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)</strong> - is a survey that measures how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are regarding their expected financial situation (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cci.asp).</p><p><strong>Corporate finance</strong> - deals with the capital structure of a corporation, including its funding and the actions that management takes to increase the value of the company. Corporate finance also includes the tools and analysis utilized to prioritize and distribute financial resources.

The term ‘Dividends’ signifies the payment declared by a company’s board of directors and given to its shareholders out of the company’s current or retained earnings, usually quarterly/yearly. Dividends include cash (cash dividend), stock (stock dividend), other property (S&amp;P Capital. Market Intelligence, 2018).</p><p><strong>Dividend signaling theory</strong> - is a theory that suggests that a company announcement of an increase in dividend payouts is an indication of positive future prospects (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendsignaling.asp). </p><p><strong>Dividend Yield (DY)</strong> (Block, Hirt, Danielsen, Short, &amp; Perretta, 2012, p. 26) - represents the yield in immediate returns via dividends, and is calculated as per formula</p><p class="align-center">DY = (Dividends per share) / (Market Share Price)</p><p><strong>Dummy variables</strong> - The way a dichotomous (two group) independent variable is represented in regression analysis by assigning a 0 to one group and a 1 to the other (Zikmund, 2009, p.585).</p><h2 class="msg msg--info">E</h2><p>Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) - </p><p> </p><p><strong>Earnings (net income or loss)</strong> (Block, Hirt, Danielsen, Short, &amp; Perretta, 2012, p.720) - represent the periodic value (not cash necessarily) available to shareholders after expenses are subtracted from revenues.</p><p><strong>Earnings Growth</strong> - can be calculated based on Net Income value, which is similar to Afza &amp; Tahir’s (2012, p. 336) and Dutta, Saha, &amp; Das (2018, p. 169) approach, i.e. using the formula</p><p class="align-center">Del(NI) = 100 x (NI(t) - NI(t-1)) / (NI(t-1))</p><p><strong>Earnings per Share (EPS)</strong> (Block, Hirt, Danielsen, Short, &amp; Perretta, 2012, p. 720) -represents the earnings available to common shareholders divided by the number of common stock shares outstanding.</p><p><strong>EBITDA</strong> - stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization and is a metric used to evaluate a company’s operating performance.</p><p><strong>Earnings volatility</strong> - is a statistical concept that determines the associated risk and helps predict the market price of a particular stock (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/earnings-volatility/).</p><p><strong>Economic conditions</strong> - are the present state of affairs in the overall economy of a country or geographical region. The conditions develop over time through various business and economic cycles (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/economic-conditions/).</p><p><strong>Emerging markets</strong> - is a term that refers to an economy that experiences considerable economic growth and possesses some, but not all, characteristics of a developed economy. Emerging markets are countries that are transitioning from the “developing” phase to the “developed” phase (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/emerging-markets/).</p><p>An <strong>equity market</strong> - is a hub in which shares of companies are issued and traded. The market comes in the form of an exchange – which facilitates the trade between buyers and sellers – or over-the-counter (OTC) in which buyers and sellers find each other. The equity market is also referred to as the stock market and is one of the most important leading indicators of the market economy. (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/equity-market/).</p><p><strong>Enterprise Value (EV)</strong> - is the measure of a company’s total value. It looks at the entire market value rather than just the equity value, so all ownership interests and asset claims from both debt and equity are included. EV can be thought of as the effective cost of buying a company or the theoretical price of a target company (before a takeover premium is considered). The simple formula for enterprise value is:</p><p class="align-center">EV = Market Capitalization + Market Value of Debt – Cash and Equivalents</p><p>The extended formula is:</p><p class="align-center">EV = Common Shares + Preferred Shares + Market Value of Debt +</p><p class="align-center">+Minority Interest – Cash and Equivalents</p><p>(https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/what-is-enterprise-value-ev/).</p><p><strong>EV/Capital Employed Ratio</strong> - is a measure of enterprise value normalized by the level of capital used by the business. For example, a large business with a large capital stock is bound to realize a large enterprise value solely due to its large capital holdings. Formula used is:</p><p class="align-center">EV/Capital Employed Ratio = EV / (Total Assets - Total Liabilities)</p><p>(https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/ev-capital-employed-ratio/).</p><p><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong> - is a ratio that compares a company’s Enterprise Value (EV) to its Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation &amp; Amortization (EBITDA).

Financial statements are often audited by government agencies, accountants, firms, etc. to ensure accuracy and for tax, financing, or investing purposes (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp).</p><p>A <strong>Fiscal Year (FY)</strong> - also known as a <strong>budget year</strong>, is a period of time used by the government and businesses for accounting purposes to formulate annual financial statements and reports. A fiscal year consists of 12-months or 52-weeks and might not end on December 31. A period which is set from January 1 to December 31 is called a calendar year (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/fy-fiscal-year/).</p><p><strong>Foreign exchange</strong> (Forex or FX) - is the conversion of one currency into another at a specific rate known as the foreign exchange rate.</p><p><strong>Forced entry</strong> (or Enter as it is known in SPSS) - is a method in which all predictors are forced into the regression model simultaneously. This method relies on good theoretical reasons for including the chosen predictors, but unlike hierarchical the experimenter makes no decision about the order in which variables are entered (Field, 2009, p.212-213).</p><p>The <strong>SPSS predefined forward and backward</strong> options - are stepwise regression methods that decide about the order in which predictors are entered into the regression model, purely based on a mathematical criterion.</p><p>In the <strong>forward method</strong>, an initial model is defined that contains only the constant (b0). The computer then searches for the predictor (out of the ones available) that best predicts the outcome variable – it does this by selecting the predictor that has the highest simple correlation with the outcome. If this predictor significantly improves the ability of the model to predict the outcome, then this predictor is retained in the model and the computer searches for a second predictor. The criterion used for selecting this second predictor is that it is the variable that has the largest semi-partial correlation with the outcome. As such, this semi-partial correlation gives a measure of how much ‘new variance’ in the outcome can be explained by each remaining predictor (see section 6.6). The predictor that accounts for the most new variance is added to the model and, if it makes a significant contribution to the predictive power of the model, it is retained and another predictor is considered. The <strong>backward method</strong> is the opposite of the forward method in that the computer begins by placing all predictors in the model and then calculating the contribution of each one by looking at the significance value of the t-test for each predictor. This significance value is compared against a removal criterion (which can be either an absolute value of the test statistic or a probability value for that test statistic). If a predictor meets the removal criterion (i.e. if it is not making a statistically significant contribution to how well the model predicts the outcome variable) it is removed from the model and the model is re-estimated for the remaining predictors. The contribution of the remaining predictors is then reassessed (Field, 2009, p.212-213).</p><p>The <strong>Forward P/E ratio</strong> (leading P/E or estimated P/E ratio) - P/E ratio based on earnings per share projected by analysts for the next fiscal year (see Chapter 11 in Bonham, Langdon, &amp; Epstein, 2008).</p><h2 class="msg msg--info">G</h2><p><strong>G7</strong> - stands for “Group of Seven” industrialized nations. The group includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, France and Italy (https://time.com/5657375/what-is-g7/).</p><p><strong>Gallup poll</strong> - a series of questions asked of a group of people in order to find out what they think about a particular subject or how they will vote in an election (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gallup-poll).</p><p><strong>Gross domestic product (GDP)</strong> - is a standard measure of a country’s economic health and an indicator of its standard of living.

These types of hypotheses are very common in causal designs (Zikmund, 2009, p.509).</p><p><strong>Hypotheses about differences from some standard</strong> - examine how some variable differs from some preconceived standard. The preconceived standard sometimes represents the true value of the variable in a population. These tests can involve either a test of a mean for better-than ordinal variables or a test of frequencies if the variable is ordinal or nominal. These tests typify univariate statistical tests (Zikmund, 2009, p.509).</p><h2 class="msg msg--info">I</h2><p><strong>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)</strong> - </p><p><strong>Income Statement</strong> - is one of the three fundamental financial statements that shows company’s profit and loss over a period of time.  The profit or loss is determined by taking all revenues and subtracting all expenses from both operating and non-operating activities (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/income-statement/).</p><p><strong>Idiosyncratic effects</strong> - are factors unique to individual entities (Jordan, 2009, p.91).
